# Clustering Iris and Image Data

In this project, the well-known iris dataset and an image dataset of handwritten digits were used to judge the robustness of a K-Means clustering algorithm made from scratch. 

The K-Means clustering algorithm was written from scratch to gain a better understanding of the algorithm (things like how cosine distance was calculated however was not implemented from scratch)

V-measure was used to evaluate the clusters created.

Highest V-measure on iris dataset: 0.95
Highest V-measure on image dataset: 0.46

Please see the accompanying report for more details.
